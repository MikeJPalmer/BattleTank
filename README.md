# BattleTank
An open world head to head tank fight with simple AI, city terrain, and advanced control systems in UE 4.25

Built in conjunction with the lecture found [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/unrealcourse/learn/lecture/4843694#overview) on Udemy.com.

I have taken some liberties during the course of the lecture so this will not be identical to the presentation within the lecture.  For example: My plan is to implement a City landscape for the level instead of an open landscape with terrain.  I will be utilizing assets purchased within the Unreal Marketplace to achieve this.

SFX may also be different but the heart of the overall code will be similar if not the same in most areas.
